#GoCryptoMe
Official Repository for OST Phase II -w/GoCryptoMe

GoCryptoMe™ is a website which functions as a donation to those in need (Much like GoFundMe), and a few advantages of this website over GoFundMe include faster payouts (To verified members, using OST's KYC process), anonymity, and security. Here at GoCryptoMe™, we are utilizing OST KIT to create and mint our own cryptocurrency, and use the KYC KIT to secure and validate the identity of our members.
